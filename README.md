# AutomateVehicleServiceStation
Developed an IoT based project which will automate the vehicle service station.
An blueetooth HC05 Module will be attached to all vehicles and then when the vehicle comes for servicing automatically all data related to
vehicle will be available for the mechanic to inspect the vehicle. Further mechanic can also handle the current proceesing of the vehicle 
and keep record of items purchased for vehicle and generate bill for the customer.
